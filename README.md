This repository demonstrates a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for developing a quantitative trading strategy. It includes a custom OpenAI Gym environment that simulates a stock trading scenario using engineered technical indicators, and it uses Stable-Baselines3’s Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to learn a trading policy.

Overview
In this project, we:

Simulate Stock Market Data: Generate sample stock data with realistic noise.

Feature Engineering: Compute various technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, Bollinger Bands, ATR, CCI, etc.) to create a rich state space.

Custom Trading Environment: Build an OpenAI Gym environment that mimics a trading day, allowing the agent to decide whether to buy, sell, or hold.

Deep Reinforcement Learning: Train a DQN agent using Stable-Baselines3 to learn a policy that maximizes portfolio value.

Evaluation & Visualization: Evaluate the trained agent and visualize the portfolio value over time.

Features
Custom Trading Environment: A simplified gym environment that provides market states and handles trading actions with basic portfolio management.

Comprehensive Technical Indicators: Engineered features include moving averages, volatility, RSI, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, Bollinger Band width, Williams %R, ATR, CCI, and lag features.

DRL Implementation: Uses Stable-Baselines3 to train a DQN agent, showcasing how DRL can be applied to trading.

Visualization: Tools to plot portfolio performance over time for analysis and strategy evaluation.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DRL-Stock-Trading.git
cd DRL-Stock-Trading
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Example requirements.txt might include:

nginx
Copy
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
gym
stable-baselines3
scipy
Usage
Run the training script:

bash
Copy
python your_script.py
This script will:

Generate sample stock data and compute technical indicators.

Create the custom trading environment.

Train a DQN agent to trade using the environment.

Evaluate the agent’s performance and plot portfolio value over time.

Customize the Environment and Agent:

Feel free to modify the environment (state, reward function, action space) or experiment with other DRL algorithms (like PPO or A2C) available in Stable-Baselines3.

Results
The trained agent learns to trade based on the engineered features, with the goal of maximizing portfolio value. The repository provides visualization of the agent’s performance, including cumulative returns and trading positions.

Future Improvements
Enhanced Reward Functions: Experiment with risk-adjusted rewards or more realistic transaction cost models.

More Robust Data: Integrate real market data and extend the environment to support multiple assets.

Algorithm Comparison: Compare different DRL algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC) for trading performance.

Portfolio Optimization: Extend the framework to handle portfolio allocation instead of a single asset.
